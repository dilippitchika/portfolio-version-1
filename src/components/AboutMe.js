            <p> This quote describes my idea of an outstanding experience. Hey, thanks a lot for checking out my work. I don't have much experience yet, but my dedication to be better makes me a great choice.</p>
            <p> I am a final year Mechanical student at Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur graduating in May 2018. I stumbled upon UX design when I was leading my team in a competition and have never left it. It's a long story, but it's worth it.</p>
            <p> So If you want to know more about me, my work or this crazy story of my career please hit me up. I would be happy to share my thoughts, no matter which field you are into.</p>
            <p> You can find in depth writing in my medium posts describing the process I follow for own projects in <a href='http://medium.com/@Dilippitchika'>here</a></p>
